My purpose in creating this was to A: provide a set of instructions which allow a user to create an image gallery component in React, and B: illustrate a conceptual framework that is sufficiently generic to be applied and adapted to a wide variety of use
cases. 

Notably, the component created is minimalist in terms of its features and styling. It is meant as a starting point for developers to create a more complex and fully-featured image gallery component. Furthermore, it is dependent on both its prerequisites and parent component for functionality. Its intended audience is developers who are familiar with React and JavaScript, but may not have experience creating image gallery components.
