 My intent here was to provide an overview and simple user guide for my Bonsai Book application, which I developed as a personal project along with my collaborators. Notably, this application is in the early stages of development, and is not fully functional. That is to say, at time of writing some of the features I discuss are not yet implemented. This documentation is addressed primarily to users, but also serves as a conceptual overview for developers who may be interested in contributing.
